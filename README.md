# Lotus
We all know saurik, the grate god behind all the big things in the jailbreak community.
One of his projects is, Cytyle, CSS and JS for the look and feel of Cydia and the depictions of most repositories.
He's busy a lot with updating stuff and improving the user experience, a while ago, Cydia got its big update for iOS 7. But the iOS 7-ish look for the pages was still missing. :(

That's where I came in, it took me a while, and published these files for you to use on your repository or even your website.

This is still __work in progress__ though, be sure to check back later for an even better version of Lotus!
